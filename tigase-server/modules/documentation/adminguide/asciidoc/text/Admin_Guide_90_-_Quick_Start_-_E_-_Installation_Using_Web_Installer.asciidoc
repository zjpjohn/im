When Tigase XMPP Server starts up, it looks for the default configuration file: *etc/init.properties*. If this file has not been modified you can run the web installer. Which will step you through the process of configuring Tigase.

Download and Extract
--------------------

First download Tigase XMPP Server and extract it. You can download the link:https://projects.tigase.org/projects/tigase-server/files[official binaries], or the latest and greatest link:http://build.xmpp-test.net/nightlies/dists/[nightly builds].

[source,bash]
-------------------------------------
$ wget http://build.xmpp-test.net/nightlies/dists/2015-01-12/tigase-server-7.0.0-SNAPSHOT-b3752-dist-max.tar.gz
$ tar -xf tigase-server-7.0.0-SNAPSHOT-b3752-dist-max.tar.gz
$ cd tigase-server-7.0.0-SNAPSHOT-b3752
-------------------------------------

Please do not run as root.

Start the Server
----------------

[source,bash]
-------------------------------------
scripts/tigase.sh start
-------------------------------------

Verify Tigase is Running
------------------------

You should see a list of listening ports.

[source,bash]
-------------------------------------
$ lsof -i -P
COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE   DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
java    18387 tigase  141u  IPv6 22185825      0t0  TCP *:8080 (LISTEN)
java    18387 tigase  148u  IPv6 22185834      0t0  TCP *:5222 (LISTEN)
java    18387 tigase  149u  IPv6 22185835      0t0  TCP *:5223 (LISTEN)
java    18387 tigase  150u  IPv6 22185836      0t0  TCP *:5290 (LISTEN)
java    18387 tigase  151u  IPv6 22185837      0t0  TCP *:5280 (LISTEN)
java    18387 tigase  152u  IPv6 22185838      0t0  TCP *:5269 (LISTEN)
-------------------------------------

Connect to the Web Installer
----------------------------

Some points before you can connect:

. If AuthRepository is not configured then access is allowed (initial installation).
. If it is accessed on localhost then access is allowed.
. If user is authenticated by jid and password as user from admins of Tigase XMPP Server then access is allowed.
. In other case access is denied.

Point your browser to *http://localhost:8080/setup/* unless you are working remotely. Then you can use the domain name, or IP address. I used http://tpub.xmpp-test.net:8080/setup/ for this guide.

Step Through the Installation Process
-------------------------------------

You will be greeted by the following "About software" page.

Read it and then click "Next"

Here we have the licensing page. Please read though the agreement, type your name and click "Next".

The software reads your current *etc/init.properties* file and presents it. Here we have a bare bones new installation. Click "Next".

Here we have the domain, database type, and admin account configuration screen. I've chosen Derby. Possible options are MySQL, PostgresSQL, and SQLServer. Tick the advanced box if you think you want a non standard installation.

The Advanced configuration page. Select what you need.

Plugins which will be loaded by the server.

This is where the database schema is installed.

You should see a page like this after success.

The installation is complete and this is what the new *init.properties* will look like. Click "Save" to write the file to disk.

Setup has finished. Go back into the installation directory and restart.

[source,bash]
-------------------------------------
$ scripts/tigase.sh stop
$ scripts/tigase.sh start
-------------------------------------

To further fine tune the server you should edit etc/tigase.conf. Ensure *JAVA_HOME* path is correct, and increase memory if needed using *JAVA_OPTIONS* -Xmx (max), and -Xms (initial). You will need to direct Tigase to read settings from this file on startup as follows.

[source,bash]
-------------------------------------
$ scripts/tigase.sh start etc/tigase.conf
-------------------------------------

Everything should be running smooth at this point. Check the logfiles in logs/ if you experience any problems.
