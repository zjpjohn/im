Starting with version 5.2.0 Tigase Server we switch for generating distribution packages from Ant to Maven. This will allow better depencency management as well as build repeatability.

Distribution Packages
---------------------
Starting from version 5.2.0 there will be two separate archives:

- minimal version (-dist) containing only tigase-server, tigase-xmltools and tigase-utils
- max version (-dist-max) containing all additional tigase components (MUC, PubSub, HTTP API, OSGi support, etc.) as well as dependencies required by those components.

They will be available as both zip and tarball.

Building Server and Generating Packages
---------------------------------------
After cloning tigase-server repository:

[source,bash]
git clone https://repository.tigase.org/git/tigase-server.git
cd tigase-server

You compile server with maven using project distribution profile (dist):

[source,bash]
mvn -Pdist -f modules/master/pom.xml clean install

This will:

- compile server
- generate javadoc
- grab all latest versions of all declared depencencies and put them in jars/ directory
- create both types of distribution packages (-dist and -dist-max) and place them in pack/ directory

In order to create instalator packages you have to execute two shell scripts:

[source,bash]
-------------------------------
./scripts/installer-prepare.sh
./scripts/installer-generate.sh
-------------------------------

However, in order for them to succeed you have to build server first using maven as described earlier. You should also have git, python2, docutils and LaTeX distribution installed (please see src/main/izpack/README.txt for details).

Running Server
--------------
Afterwards you can run the server with the regular shell script:

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
./scripts/tigase.sh start etc/tigase.conf
-----------------------------------------

Please bear in mind, that you should provide correct setup in etc/init.properties configuration files for the server to work correctly.
