*Default value:* 'custom string.'

*Example:* +--comp-name-1 = muc+

*Possible values:* 'XMPP localnode string.'

*Description:* The property is used to assign name 'name' to the non-standard component which is loaded by the server. It is normally used when you want to load component which is not loaded by the +config-type+ you use. Together with +--comp-class-1+ it allows you to load any extra component to your server configuration. Of course you can load more than just one component. Just use +--comp-name-2+, +--comp-name-3+ and so on... Let's say you want to load the MUC component. You can then put give it a name: +muc+ and the setting would look like:

[source,bash]
