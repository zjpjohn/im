In order to enable SASL External add following line to the  +init.properties+ file

[source,bash]
-------------------------------------
c2s/clientCertCA=/path/to/cacert.pem
-------------------------------------

File +cacert.pem+ contains Certificate Authority certificate which is used to sign clients certificate.

Client certificate must include user's Jabber ID as +XmppAddr+ in +subjectAltName+:

_As specified in RFC 3920 and updated in RFC 6120, during the stream negotiation process an XMPP client can present a certificate (a “client certificate”). If a JabberID is included in a client certificate, it is encapsulated as an id-on-xmppAddr Object Identifier (“xmppAddr”), i.e., a subjectAltName entry of type otherName with an ASN.1 Object Identifier of “id-on-xmppAddr” as specified in Section 13.7.1.4 of RFC 6120.
