Well it is authentication against *Drupal* database at the moment. So it is not full integration with *Drupal* yet.

As *Drupal* keeps encrypted passwords in database the only possible authorization protocols are those based on PLAIN passwords.

To protect your passwords *Tigase* server must be used with SSL or TLS encryption.

Implementation of *Drupal* database based authorization is located in +tigase.db.jdbc.DrupalAuth+ class. Although this class is capable of adding new user to the repository I recommend to switch in-band registration off due to the caching problems in *Drupal.* Changes in database are not synchronized with *Drupal* yet. Function for adding new users is implemented only to ease user accounts migration from different repository type from earlier *Tigase* server installation.

The idea of that implementation was to allow all accounts administration tasks from *Drupal* like: account creation, all accounts settings, like e-mail, full name, password changes and so on.

*Tigase* server uses following fields from *Drupal* database: name (user account name), pass (user account password), status (status of the account). Server picks up all changes instantly. If user status is not 1 then server won't allow user to login trough Jabber/XMPP even if user provides valid password.

There is no _Roster_ management in *Drupal* yet. So Roster management have to be done from Jabber/XMPP client.
