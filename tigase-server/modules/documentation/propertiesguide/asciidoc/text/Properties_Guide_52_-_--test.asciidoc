*Description:* This property sets the server for a test mode, which means that all loggings are turned off, message offline storage is off and possibly some other changes to the system configuration are being made.

The idea behind this mode is to test the Tigase XMPP Server with minimal performance impact from environment such as hard drive, database and others...

*Available since:* 2.0.0
