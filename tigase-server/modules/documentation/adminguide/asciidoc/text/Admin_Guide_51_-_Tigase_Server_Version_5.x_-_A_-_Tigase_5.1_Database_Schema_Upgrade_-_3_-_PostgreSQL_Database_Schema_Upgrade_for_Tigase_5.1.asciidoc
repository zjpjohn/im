Unfortunately we had to make a small change to the database schema for 5.1.0 version of the Tigase server.

The good news it does not affect data or data structure, only the way some data is accessed in database. We added one more stored procedure which has to be installed in database if you upgrade your installation from a previous Tigase version.

Therefore the schema upgrade is very simple and safe but make sure the current database schema is in version 4.0.

Assumptions:

- *tigasedb* is a database name
- *tigase_user* is a database user name
- *admin_db_user* is database admin user name

First things first - make a database backup:

[source,sql]
-------------------------------------
pg_dump -U tigase_user -W tigasedb > tigasedb_dump.sql
-------------------------------------

If you need to restore database for any reason execute following commands:

[source,sql]
-------------------------------------
dropdb -U admin_db_user -W tigasedb
createdb -U admin_db_user -W -O tigase_user tigasedb
psql -U tigase_user -W tigasedb < tigasedb_dump.sql
-------------------------------------

Now we can run schema upgrade script

[source,sql]
-------------------------------------
psql -q -U tigase_user -W tigasedb -f database/postgresql-schema-upgrade-to-5-1.sql
-------------------------------------
