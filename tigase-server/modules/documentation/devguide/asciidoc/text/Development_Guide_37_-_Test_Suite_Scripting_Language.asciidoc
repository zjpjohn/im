The test suite contains also scripting language which allows you to combine test cases into a test scenarios. On the lowest level, however the language is designed to allow you to describe the test by setting test parameters, test comments, identification and so on.

Let's look at the example test description.  

[source,java,numbered]
------------------------------------------------------------------
Short name@test-id-1;test-id-2: Short description for the test case
{
 -loop = 10
 -user-name = Frank
 # This is a comment which is ignored
}
>> Long, detailed description of the test case <<
------------------------------------------------------------------

Meaning of all elements:

. *Short name* is any descriptive name you want. It doesn't need to be unique, just something which tells you what this test is about.@ is a separator between the short name and the test ids.
. *test-id-1;test-id-2* is a semicolon separated of the test cases IDs. The tests cases are executed in the listed order. And listing them there means that the test-id-2 depends on test-id-1. Normally you don't have to list all the dependencies because all mandatory dependencies are included automatically. Which means if you have an authentication test case the suite adds automatically network socket connection and stream opening. Sometimes however there are dependencies which are optional or multiple mandatory dependencies and you can select which one has to be executed. As a good example is authentications test case. There are many authentication tests: PLAIN-AUTH, SASL-DIGESTMD5, SASL-PLAIN, DIGEST-AUTH and they are all mandatory for most of other tests like roster, presence and so on. One of the authentication tests is a default dependency but if you put on the list different authentication it will be used instead of default one.
. *:* is a separator between test cases ids list and the short test description.
. Short test description is placed between : - colon and opening *{* - curly bracket. This is usually quite brief, single line test description.
. *{  }* curly brackets contain all the test parameters, like how many times the test has to be executed or run the test in a separate thread, user name, host IP address for the network connection and many others.
. *>>  <<* inside the double greater than and double less than you put a very long, multiple line test description.

Between an open curly bracket { and close one } you can put all the test case parameters you wish. The format for it is:

*-parameter-name = value*

Parameter names always start with \'*-*'. Note, some parameters don't need any value. They can exist on their own without any value assigned:

*-debug-on-error*

It works like you set "*yes*" or "*true*" for this parameter but you don't set anything.

The scripting language includes also support for variables which can be assigned any value and used multiple times later on. You assign a value to the variable the same way as you assign it to the parameter:

*$(variable-name) = value*

The variable name must be always enclosed with brackets *()* and start with \'*$*'.

The value may be enclosed within double quotes *""* or double quotes may be omitted. If this is a simple string like a number or character string consisting only of digits, letters, underscore \'*_*' and hyphen \'*-*' then you can omit double quotes otherwise you must enclose the value.

The test case descriptions can be nested inside other test case descriptions. Nested test case descriptions inherit parameters and variables from outer test case description.
