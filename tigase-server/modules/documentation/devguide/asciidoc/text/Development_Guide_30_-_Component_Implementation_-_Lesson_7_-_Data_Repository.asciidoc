There are cases when you want to store some data permanently by your component. You can of course use the component configuration to provide some database connection settings, implement your own database connector and store records you need. There is, however, a very simple and useful framework which allows you to read and store some data transparently in either database or disk file. The framework also supports ad-hoc commands interface straight away so you can manipulate your component data using a good XMPP client.

This guide will teach you how to create a simple data repository and use it in your component. The repository can be automatically exposed via ad-hoc commands and you can change your data from any XMPP client.
