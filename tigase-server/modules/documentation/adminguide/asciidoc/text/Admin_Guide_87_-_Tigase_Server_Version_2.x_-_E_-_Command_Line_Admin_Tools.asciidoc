Two command line tools have been created to make it easier to manage server configuration and user repository.

Configuration tool allows to look at configuration settings and modify parameters. It takes care about proper parameters types and encoding.

Repository management tool allows to print repository content for all or for selected users. Modify repository data, add, delete users and copy data from one repository to another.

This guide describe how to efficiently use command line tools which are available for user repository and configuration management.

These 2 command line tools for managing configuration and repository are:

. link:http://server.tigase.org/browser/trunk/scripts/config.sh[config.sh] for configuration management.
. link:http://server.tigase.org/browser/trunk/scripts/repo.sh[repo.sh] for repository management.

Both scripts call class from Tigase package. If you run any of those script with *-h* parameter you will get help screen describing all available parameters. 

I will not concentrate on that help information which is easily accessible anyway. This guide will focus on particular use cases. So it will answer to questions: "How to do it with the tool?".
