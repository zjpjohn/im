Unfortunately we had to make a small change to the database schema for 5.1.0 version of the Tigase server.

The good news it does not affect data or data structure, only the way some data is accessed in database. We added one more stored procedure which has to be installed in database if you upgrade your installation from a previous Tigase version.

Therefore the schema upgrade is very simple and safe but make sure the current database schema is in version 4.0. If you happen to use ancient version of the Tigase before number 4.0 and you want to upgrade to 5.1 you have to run ////<<40schemaUpgrade,////4.0 upgrade script first.

Assumptions:
 
. *tigasedb* is a database name 
. *tigase_user* is a database user name 
. *mypass* is database user password 

First things first - make a database backup:

[source,sh]
-------------------------------------
mysqldump -u tigase_user -pmypass tigasedb > tigasedb_dump.sql
-------------------------------------

If you need to restore database for any reason execute following commands:

[source,sh]
-------------------------------------
msyqladmin -u tigase_user -pmypass drop tigasedb
mysqladmin -u tigase_user -pmypass create tigasedb
mysql -u tigase_user -pmypass tigasedb < tigasedb_dump.sql
-------------------------------------

_Note! You may be required to use root user and his password to execute mysqladmin commands._

Now we can run schema upgrade script

[source,sh]
-------------------------------------
mysql -u tigase_user -pmypass tigasedb < database/mysql-schema-upgrade-to-5-1.sql
-------------------------------------
